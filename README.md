- 👋 Hi, I’m @rainwing-lol
- 👀 I’m interested in desinging the reigns to ride the robots.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning .about how to apply design thinking further upstream, while getting more comfortable with code in order to live out the "no-code" promise.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that make a difference in Healthcare, Safety, and enteprise badassery.
- 📫 How to reach me lol@rainwing.com
- 😄 Pronouns: He/him/m'lord
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm only pretty sure I'm a real person, and I'm less sure every day.
